# BrainCanadaMangementSys
Management system to match Brain Canada applicants to the reviewers in the most similar field. 
Uses Pandas library to convert .xlsx file to a readable dataframe for the applicants and the reviewers.
Uses Levenshtein library to measure the difference in characters between the applicants and the reviewers primary research field.
Then takes user input to select the applicant and tells the user the top 3 reviewers with the smallest amount of difference to that applicant's primary research field.
